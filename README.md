DNA: Deoxyribonucleic Acid

In DNA there are four different base :- A -> Adenine, G -> Guanine, C -> Cytosine, T -> Thymine
Instructions in DNA are first transcribed into RNA and then into protein.
Oreder of transmossion of instructions :-  DNA -> RNA -> Proteins

In this project we had downloaded a DNA standard text file from a public web-based repository. Then we had written a code to translate DNA 
sequence to a sequence of amino acid, where each amino acid is represented by unique letter.

Task we had accomplished in this project are written below :
  1. Manually download DNA and protein sequence data in computer.
  2. Import DNA data into python.
  3. Create an algorithm to translate DNA.
  4. Check if translation matches your download.

Downloading DNA data :
  1. Downloading the strand DNA sequence from NCBI (Nucleotide -> MN_207618.2)
  2. Then click on FASTA and copy the DNA sequence.
  3. Click on CDS, and copy the protein sequence.
